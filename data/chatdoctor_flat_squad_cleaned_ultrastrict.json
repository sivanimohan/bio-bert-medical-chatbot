Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all.
