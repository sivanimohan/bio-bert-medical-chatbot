Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!",
    "context": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.",

I wake up a lot in the middle of the night with heartburn so I chew some tums and it helps for the most part. Why is it so painful when I eat?",
    "context": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning in chest. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary.

I did clean the razor with rubbing alcohol before use however I had an open wound on my face for a while.. About a week. For about a month now I have been feeling extremely irritable, experiencing lockjaw symptoms, been short of breath, had fevers on and off, heart palpitations, and I have noticed that when I smile my face contorts into what one would call a sardonic smile.

This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert.

    "context": "Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!",

    "question": "I had a partial root canal roughly 36 hours ago on my lower left rear molar (wisdom teeth extracted years ago).  The doctor drilled out the pulp (noting that it was mostly dead) and put on a temporary filling until the root canal specialist could see me.  Now, about 36 hours later, Im in quite a bit of pain again, both on the tooth that was operated on and in a molar on the top of my jaw and in the back jaw muscle.  My neck is rather swollen too and is tender to the touch.  I have plans to travel tomorrow by plane to see some family and go diving.  Is my condition something that requires immediate attention?  Should I not be flying or diving?",

Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125\\u00a0mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500\\u00a0mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac.  Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days.

    "context": "Hi, Is she having fever? How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination.

When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not. If the doctor said that the tubes were patent(that is, not blocked), there is good chance of your getting pregnant. If your periods are regular, and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well. However, if you don't get pregnant in the next one year, do go back and see a gynecologist with interest in fertility.

Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery.

The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. Wishing you good health thank you",

In the past few days, I have done nothing that might cause these. It s happened a few times in the past, but not often. A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer.

Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles. A pinched nerve can also arise from this condition. You must consult a neurologist and probably also get a lumbar spine MRI scan done to know if there is a disc herniation or nerve impingement which is not seen clearly on SPENT CT should you experience severe pain in the region.

These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected.

There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region.

On Saturday, I started getting watery diarrhea. Later that night, my fever spiked to 103.3. I still have diarrhea and have to use the bathroom every 2-3 hours. I took a tylenol last night and the fever has not come back yet. However, I still have to keep using the bathroom and it does not seem to be getting better. Is there anything I can do to stop this?",

    "question": "My baby is of two weeks. First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly?",
    "context": "Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any.",

Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Sit with proper back and chest support. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now. So please do help me, because I really love my mom and seeing her like that pains me. Thank you!",

In this situation there is disease spread to the regional lymph nodes and this make it difficult to operate. However, treatment should be started after COSI Chat Doctor. Many patients can have good response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and show significant reduction in size of lymph nodes. This can then be assessed again and a staging can be done and if possible then operated at a later date. Bowel cancer is also seen to spread to liver in nearly half the patients, and therefore it will help to check on the liver from time to time by ultrasound scan or CT scan.

That was the end of February and now its May and the itching especially on my breasts and under my left arm (and down the arm to inside of the elbow.The itching and little bumps (like hives) are so bad you wouldnt believe it. Doctor gave me Triamcinolone 0.1% cream, but it doesnt do that well.  I tried Cortiscone from the drug store..not that great either.

    "question": "Hi, I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?",
    "context": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,",

    "question": "Hello, this is my question. I am a regular plasma donor at a facility here where I live. Every 4 months they take a blood sample to be sent off for a protein analysis, it usually takes 10 days to get the sample back. Normally I know when the sample will be taken so I take 10 days off from donating at all before and the sample always comes back fine (because I am older, 40, weight 153 and I  guess donating lowers my protein levels). I have had 2 samples come back recently with a protein of 5.9 (needs to be 6.0 or higher) and I am wondering what it is I need to be doing/and or changing to ensure that my levels are in range. Also, how is this different from the screening test they do every time I go in to donate to test my microhemocrotit? I have been out of range a couple times recently on that and was told to eat iron-rich foods. I am now including an iron supplement with my daily vitamins. I would appreciate any help or advice you could give, I am frustrated. Thank you!",

In the meanwhile, I would relieve your pain with some anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor.  Further management would depend on the result of clinical assessment and the investigation reports. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor"

Two days later he set fire to his room and tried to kill himself. He is now in the hospital lock up room and hears voices. No alcohol or drugs in his system at either time. He has been depressed before all this happened and won t tell his parents why. Are the voices and attempted suicide from the accident alone?",

Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression. When depression becomes severe, psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices, false beliefs, etc.) Moreover, since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident, it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage.  Depression can be caused due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain and need not be stress related always. So, it is not surprising that he did not reveal anything to his parents. With appropriate medication and close follow up he should be able to come out of his depression. Best wishes,-",

Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER.

        "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. If you are not having any symptoms (cough, breathlessness, chest pain) then no need to worry about hyperinflated lung field on chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is taken after deep inspiration then hyperinflated lung field can be seen on the chest x-ray. COPD diagnosis is not only on the basis of chest x-ray. PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) is needed for diagnosis of COPD. If you have any doubt then get done PFT.PFT is normal then no need to worry about COPD and you can also work in nursing home. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

        "Hi and thanks so much for this query am so sorry to hear about these repeated efforts to conceive without success. 5 months in conception is a very short time, and you would need to keep trying for up to 12 months before we can start suspecting that something isn't going on right with you. From the information you have provided, the chances of you being pregnant are almost zero right now. Not all missed periods are synonymous to pregnancy and this is clearly the case with you. It usually takes averagely 5\\u00a0days after stopping primal for bleeding to occur. I will suggest you patiently wait for the with Chat Doctor. I hope this helps. Furthermore, I wish you well."

I understand your query, however next time you take antibiotic, I recommend you to complete the full course of antibiotics such amoxicillin if given for 7 days should be followed even though the condition has improved to avoid antibiotic resistance.

I was put on several rounds of anitbiotics which got ride to most of it but still had the feeling that something was in my eustation tube in my ear because it wants to stay closed all the time.  About 2 weeks ago I again was sick and I got two mucus plugs out of my throat.  First on the left side and then about 2 hours later with one on the right side.  The one on the left side was white in color and about the size of a quarter.  The one on the right side was bigger about the size of a 50 cent piece with blood in it.  It still feels as if there is something in my throat.  I have been to so many doctors with 2 CAT scans done and nothing shows up.  Can you give some ideas on what is happening as I am so miserable.

It was put in a Velcro cast for 10 days & told to come back to fracture clinic for it re xraying & they would decide the course if treatment from there. When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time.",
    "context": "Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts",

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

    "context": "Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,",

    "context": "Cushing's disease itself can cause elevated WBC, so this may not necessarily be related to an infection. Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g., abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps.",

Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?",

However, higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry.",

    "question": "I have a degenrated disc at my L4/L5 level. It is at about 25% degeneration. My L5/S1 also has some slight degenration. I found out after pulling a muscle in my back 4 years ago. My right leg is about a centimeter shorter than my left, which is the main cause of the degeneration. I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain. I have also been experiencing intermittent pain in my left testicle. It comes and goes and sometimes moves to the right testicle. I have also noticed a frequent urge to urinate. I have noticed that not as much urine comes out and I still feel like I have to go shortly thereafter. If I massage the area near the rectum and behind the scrotum, it provides relief. Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners. There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine, blood in urine/ejaculate, etc. I have had issues with urination for at least 10 years. They include constant urge, inability to urinate when I feel the urge. I am currently uninsured, so I am trying to find some possible answers before I make it into a doctors office.",

It s a dull pain unless he eats something that aggravates it or if the area is touched then it is a sharp pain, and he says it s not a cramping pain at all, just a very bad bruised feeling.

She recommended antibiotics and a cream to be applied morning and night, to make a long story short the medicine was 600. dollars and I am a single woman raising my grandchild needless to say he was very upset when we left the drugstore what or where do we go from here? Sandra",
    "context": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that 600 dollars is a huge amount and it's even puzzling to me why a course of antibiotics and a cream would cost that much.  I presume that you don't have insurance, so the only option would be to be prescribed more cost-effective medication.  Furthermore, I would suggest that you can let the CRNP know that you cannot afford the medication and request her to prescribe something else more cost-effective and affordable. Since acne is not a serious condition, I don't think your grandson needs a very strong antibiotic or other expensive medication.  Wish you all the best.",

A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold), Losing weight, taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin, Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans, which may also present with similar picture.

There is mild global volume loss. Chronic microangiopathic changes in the old lacunar type infarcts and mild global volume loss.",
    "context": "Hello, In relation to the fall that she took the CT scan doesn't show any damage due to the hit, none of those findings are related to the trauma, they were already present before she fell and hit her head. The findings are due to chronic changes in the brain matter and its blood vessels. Chronic microangiopathic changes are changes to the small blood vessels. To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates.

We went to another doctor in March 2012 and she prescribed Lupron depot inj for 3 mths and I got my mensus in Aug 2012..I want to know what are the chances to conceive with endo and should i wait for sometime and try iui or what else can be done..please help..Regards Neha",
    "context": "Hi, As you have already tried 5 cycles of GUI after laparoscopy, it's better to try for treatment which gives better pregnancy rate which is IVF. As you have already received In Lu pron Depot for 3 months, it would have been better to go for IVF immediately after 3rd dose of Lu pron as it increases chances of pregnancy in IVF. But still It's not too late. You can go for IVF straightforwards or can again take Lu pron depot for 1-2 months & then go for IVF. IVF is definitely the best treatment for you. Wish you good health.",

As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation.

    "context": "Ventolin (Albuterol) is a bronchodilator and your doctor has prescribed it because often in case of such cough, bronchospasm occurs. He has not prescribed the wrong medicine. But if you feel that she does not have wheezing, you may skip giving it and reserve if for times of respiratory distress, if it occurs. The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough. The cold has been caused by a viral infection and generally takes 5-7 days to recover. Please be patient till then.",

    "context": "Hi and pleased to answer you. Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.

If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified. If pregnancy is excluded, you could be having slight hormonal imbalance which is common now and then whenever there is some stress, infection, weight disturbance etc. Such a disturbance usually gets corrected spontaneously.

    "question": "My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance.",

Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck.",

I find it quite hard to tell the difference between allergies and a cold. for a week now i have had varying symptoms which started with sneezing, a runny nose (extremely so!), there was a slight sore throat with it, and i now have a slight cough and a little breathlessness. There has been no fever but i do work in child care, germ central. unless i have a fever im never sure if i have a cold or allergy and im not sure if the breathlessness is asthma symptoms or not. thankyou",
    "context": "HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Allergies and common cold can be associated with similar symptoms. The main differences would be fever, change in appetite or energy level that may occur with the common cold. The time frame would also vary, if the symptoms are acute then it is more likely a cold, if they are long term-allergies. The treatment of both would be the use of decongestants (topical or oral), oral antihistamines and cough suppressants if needed. I hope this helps",

For the first 2 days I slept and took the painkillers and Ibuprofen that they had prescribed but since then my gum on the outside feels sore and kind of raw. As if my cheek is rubbing against it and the second premolar feels like its shifting downwards a little bit. Sometimes it still feels like i have a massive tooth pain there and also my teeth on the other side of my mouth are starting to hurt a little as well(Also the tooth they extracted was abscessed). Is this all normal? I m 21 and haven t had a tooth removed since I was 5 and it s kind of freaking me out that my mouth hurts this bad still since its been 5 days. Also I was curious on why I m 21(22 in may) and haven t gotten my wisdom teeth in yet.",
    "context": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, As you have mentioned the first molar you got extracted was involved with abscess. So after extraction the socket needs to be curetted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants, disinfection of the socket is done, and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze .any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Chat Doctor.  You need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth, they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years, so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdom tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any, will help in deciding treatment. I hope I answered all your doubts, take care.",

    "question": "For the past 2 or 3 months, I have had very strong, pulsing heart beats and trembly feeling inside my chest that will not go away. Also, I have severe hypertensive periods, vertigo, and tinnitus. I have a history of Hashimoto s but TSH is normal, now. I have had brain MRI, Ct scans, EKGs, carotid dopppler, blood chemistries and all appear to be within normal range, with the exception of Vit D, I have added 5,000IU/day. However, about 2 weeks ago, I had an episode of hypocalcemia, confirmed by Trousseau s sign, periorbital parysthesia, etc.. (but total serum calcium was normal). I have since added calcium supplements. I am currently on 60 mg Cardizem 3x/day but BP is still 150/90. (I had an allergic reaction to carvedilol - hives, swelling.) Have been to ER 3x recently with hypertensive episodes 200/115 and palpitations. Have been to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and PCP. Should I go to a neurologist? What other things can cause these conditions?",
    "context": "Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that these symptoms do not seem to be related to any neurological conditions, especially considering the high blood pressure values.  Coming to this point, I would recommend checking cortisol plasma levels, aldosterone plasma levels and urinary metanephrines in order to exclude a possible a Chat Doctor.  A panic disorder cannot be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend trying low dose Alprazolam during these episodes and see if your situation improves.  Hope I have answered your query.

    "context": "Hello, There could be a few reasons to your symptoms. Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission",

The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission"

My fingers sooth me and keep me calm so i can sleep in a way nothing else can. i only do it at night and when im really tired.. please help",
    "context": "Hi and welcome, Finger sucking and thumb sucking habit is very injurious as dental health is concerned. Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth.  Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and bite problems.  You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly.  Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. You can follow few steps to avoid the habit",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with biceps tendinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis of the right shoulder following a vehicle accident over 7 months ago and despite a steroid injection and months of physical therapy, I can barely move my right shoulder, is there any real help for this?",
    "context": "Hello, As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.",

    "question": "MY 29 yr old son went to the emergency room 1month ago with a quarter size lump in his neck below the ear. they tried to drain it because they originally thought it was a cyst or an infected hair follicle. With in 4 days the lump was the size of a hockey puck and extremely painful. They did surgery to remove it, but didn t take it out 2x s. Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?",
    "context": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry.",

        "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done repeat chest x-ray to see whether1. The lesion is improving2. The lesion is static3. The lesion is worsening. In pneumonia identification of causative organism is very important, so that we can give proper antibiotics. So if your lesion is improving than no need to worry. But if it is static or worsening than get done CT Thorax and Bronchoscopy with BAD (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) analysis for culture and sensitivity. By doing these we can start the specific therapy and titrate antibiotics too."

You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected, the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you.",

    "question": "Hi,The inside right cheek of my mouth does not feel smooth as the left cheek, something like a very fine sandpaper feeling. I looked with a flashlight and it looks different than the left side. Gray cast rather than pink like the left side. It is hard to see close because of the limitations of my glasses and the mirror. Do you have any ideas? What kind of doctor would I make an appointment with. Would it be a dentist, GP, or something else?",

However, a simultaneous problem has occurred that is causing a great deal of pain. I noticed that my bottom was also very painful, and when I looked there was a red and painful lump at the entrance to my anus. I took this to be a haemorrhoid. However, it is a very swollen and red perineum that is actually causing the pain. Is this related? Are they related to my back? And how can I treat it? At the moment, the combination of injuries means I can barely sit or sleep.",

    "context": "Hello, Thanks for writing to shy Chat Doctor.  Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly, and when they do, retreating the teeth can easily be done. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards.",

    "context": "Hello! Thank you for the query. Antibiotics quite often cause some gastrointestinal issues. Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer, ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP, and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found, gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards.",

    "question": "I was bitten two days ago by a fire ant, three times on my middle toe on my left foot. It became inflamed and red very quickly. I used benadryl, it stopped the itching. Yesterday morning the swelling had spread to all 4 small toes and into my foot. My doctor prescribed prednisone and topical steroid cream. Also told me to take zyrtec or clariton over the counter. I took the steroid and it seemed to reduce the swelling but by the evening two of the insect bites were black and the surrounding area was also black and swollen. I soaked my foot in epsome salts that helped the pain and reduced the redness and swelling some. Today the bites are still very black and swollen but not exceptionally painful. Should I be concerned? Should I lance them and soak again?",

    "context": "Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards.",

Pelvic causes like pelvic inflammation and endometriosis should be considered. An urinalysis also should be performed to exclude any associated infection.

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis or asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

It may be dislocated, or it may be just degenerative changes to your cervical vertebral column. These changes explain the back pain, headaches, dizziness.  Also, the changes in your cervical x-ray can be explained by this diagnosis. I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is. In the meantime you can use acetaminophen, ibuprofen or fetoprotein for the pain and avoid abrupt cervical movements. A cervical collar can help. Hope to have been helpful.

Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me",
    "context": "Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit",

You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed, and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist.

It is more defined if I shrug my shoulders up like when brushing teeth . It is not painful, rather soft, but getting larger. I recently was told I have a tumur on my thyroid right size golf ball size which is getting removed in a week or so. I just really concerned about these new bumps now, last year I had a nerve shealth tumor removed of spine that I was told was non cancerous. The FNA I had on the thyroid tumor also suggested non cancerous. I have an ultrasound scheduled for new bumps but I m getting sick to my stomach stressing about it. Can you give me any insight as to what you may believe it is? Thank you, 42 yr old Marine",

Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about , I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36, only bloods still showed infection, but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was. I got sent home with stronger anti biotics, I started to feel a bit better within 2 days but I still kept the pain for about 2 weeks after. Since all this I have been to my own GP, she redone my bloods , all came back clear accept my liver ggt which was slightly raised but not raised enough to do anything about.

    "question": "Hello. I kicked something and now my foot is slightly swollen, slightly bruised, but definitely sore. I cannot bend my big toe (which is the area where the pain originates, in the foot part just below my big toe) not because of the pain, but I physically cannot make it bend. It hurts to walk on the affected area but I can walk. I just cannot put weight on the big toe. It is painful with a mixture between dull and achy and suddenly sharp or throbbing. Though, I took a Vicodin and the pain is a lot better. The pain is more localized and the areas around it hurt less allowing me to put weight on those areas. Does this sound more like it could be a sprain since the pain medication helped with almost all of the pain aside from the milder pain I feel in the location of the bruise and swelling?",
    "context": "Dear patient You have injured your foot more so your great toe and possibility of fracture cannot be ruled out since pain is not relieved.  I would advise X-ray of involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to confirm diagnosis.  If it shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon with report.  If its normal diagnosis is sprain and recommended treatment is rest for 2 weeks and tab diclofenac 50\\u00a0mg twice a day for 5 days. All the best.",

    "question": "Why does my body feel wierd one day Im dizzy headache the next day Im tired and feel discomfort in my upper chest area and other days feels like my body wants to give up. I just feel wierd and dont know what to think. I get worried alot and stress out so I really dont know if that maybe the cause. I always think I feel like its my heart but I was checked before and its not that. I know when I did some cardio workout for a lil while couple days of the week my body felt so much better. So what could it be??",
    "context": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. Your symptoms are improving with Cardio workout. Heart and lung diseases actually precipitate after Cardio workout. So possibility of major heart and lung diseases is very less. Stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

But I had a UA done about a month ago that came back with abnormal WBC when culture and sensitivity was done it came back negative.

For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Eugenic or Paracetamol) in between fever episodes.

It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already. You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses.

So I will not advise surgery for him because of his age. Better to keep ICD and wait for resolution of pneumothorax. Better to get done sputum culture to identify organism.

On Monday I saw an orthopedist who said I had actually fractured my fibula and put me in an air cast. She said I could walk without crutches on the cast and that my swelling would go down. My foot is still swollen, but the troubling thing is that in the past 2 days I have gotten extremely light headed and felt like I was going to faint (this has never happened before). This has happened after long periods of walking/moving around. Could this be related to my ankle?",

If so please check this could be related to that. Also, what is your age? Are you on any High blood pressure medication? Are you diabetic? If the above one doesn't fit your category than this should be just having weakness of the body and nothing else. For swelling, I would advise you to keep the leg elevated over a pillow at most times because you have a cast applied and also there is very less mobility, so there will be an obvious chance of reduced venous return. Keeping the leg elevated helps more. Try having Lemon juice with added auger and pinch of salt for dizziness. Rest assured, you should do well.  Hope I have answered your query.

You are not supposed to wear retainers for at least two weeks till the gums over the implant heal well. Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a \\\"soft tissue liners\\\" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it's not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase. Avoid for two weeks and consult your dentist. Let him do a clinical examination and take an x-ray of the area. Be cautious if you see \\\"pus\\\" coming out. that's a sign of infection.

Or if it is too important then your retainers must be lined by a \\\"soft tissue liners\\\" which will prevent any trauma to the underlying gums when you wear the retainer. it's not a good idea to wear retainer in post surgical phase. Avoid for two weeks and consult your dentist. Let him do a clinical examination and take an x-ray of the area. Be cautious if you see \\\"pus\\\" coming out. that's a sign of infection. Must go back to your dentist and talk. Good luck."

Now that I m pregnant I am still getting black discharge and I now have what seems like a blister right beside my nipple. What should I do?",

Blisters on the nipples or around them (in the areolar region), most commonly occur due to 2 reasons, either due to friction (from clothing, sexual activity, etc.; or what we call a milk blister which occurs while breastfeeding.

It is true that chemotherapy and radiation have very serious side effects and can themselves cause cancer. But at stage 4 that is the best possible treatment available. I would advise you to continue with your treatment. But you can talk to your doctor if you do not wish it and ask him/her for some other palliative treatment. Hope this helps."

    "question": "my son has really foul smelling stools. What could be the issue besides possibly lactose intolerance & celiac disease? He is 7 years old. He had a upper GI endoscopy done a few years ago and at that time he was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and they also mentioned that he had lower than average lactase levels. His dairy intake is not excessive. He has a glass of milk in the morning or afternoon and occasionally pizza. I m concerned because although he has no other symptoms such as stomach discomfort or gas or bloating, his stools are really malodorous to the point where we have to have him change his underwear and shorts often for no other apparent reason. Please advise. Thank you!",
    "context": "The foul smelling stools could be due to overgrowth of certain bacteria in his intestines. A course of metronidazole thrice daily for 5 days should be helpful. Also give him plenty of curd. You may skip the glass of milk in the morning and give other nutritive food items instead. The primary manifestation of lactose intolerance would be bloating and abdominal distention which your child does not have. In case of celiac disease, failure to grow properly and frequency of stool are generally present.",

I would insist on an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out a renal calculus, which a CT might not be able to pick up, causing this kind of pain. If inconclusive, and the pain increases or is not relieved, I would refer you to a general surgeon for a clinical assessment and related investigation like a diagnostic laparoscopy for further management of the problem. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Also, morning pills are protective in 75% cases. So, I cannot rule out pregnancy in your case. In my opinion, first, you get a serum beta Chat Doctor test done to diagnose pregnancy only if you have missed your period and, if it comes out to be positive then, one ultrasound to see gestation and location of pregnancy. Only after that, you should think of abortion. Hope this helps."

But he is moving his hand and legs very well but still not started to crawl. When we make him stnd he keeps on jumping and climbing up. Is there any problem",

At 6 month babies are usually sitting on the floor without any support and around 10 months of age they try to stand and walk with some support. According to your history the baby shows appropriate developmental stage. So do not worry. Fits may be due to febrile convulsions which may not need any treatment and usually resolve after 5 year of age.(But history is not sufficient to tell whether it is febrile convulsions)",

If you are having regular ovulation, there may not be any problem in getting pregnancy. Track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising.

    "question": "I have a DVT factor 8, had this condition for 11 years. I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?",
    "context": "Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,",

    "question": "I am having symptoms of a sore tongue and gums, like the skin in my mouth is tight.  It is a dull ache most severe on the sides of my tongue and lower parts of the inside of my gums.  My teeth are not sore and I really am healthy with no other symptoms.  It is painful to eat, hence the concern.  Anything you may be able to deduce from this?  Thanks for your help! Gabe",
    "context": "Hi. Thanks for the query. It looks like you have inflammation inside mouth. Due to inflammation you are experiencing pain and soreness. Inflammation and soreness can be due to numerous causes, but common ones are allergy to certain foods or chemicals, deficiency of or vitamin B 12 or both, burning the inside of mouth while eating something very hot or irritation with any chemical substances or mouthwash etc. Fungal infection can be another cause. So first consult an Oral Physician and get the cause ruled out. Treatment of the same will help in relieving the oral symptoms too. For now symptoms can be managed with gargling with numbing mouthwash containing Lidocaine like Magic Mouthwash. Start taking vitamin B complex supplements daily. You can also do cool water rinses and suck ice as both of these can absorb heat and reduce inflammation. Avoid hot, acidic and spicy foods. Hope this helps. Regards.",

    "context": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to more complicated- High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. In children, common causes are Gilbert's disease or hepatitis viral. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting certain liver issues. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

    "question": "we were told our child may have abdominal migraines- both of this parents have regular migraines( headaches) and strong family history of headache migraines on both maternal and paternal sides.  One family member ( adult) has abdominal migraines.  Our child has what appears to be very strong episodes of nausea that can last for as long as six hours but usually around 1 to two hours.  nausea is in waves.  He gets extremely pale and says his cheeks feel numb and then sometimes his hands and arms do as well.. this can last as long as nausea sometimes.. I thought the tingling sensations might be panic related ( panics when the nausea is very bad) but GI doc said tingling should not last that long with panic.  He also has dark circles often with these and more recently has complained of back bothering him when he has these episodes.  He has had stomach cramping for two months now as well as the nausea but nausea is getting more severe... he had upper and lower scoping done and has been recently diagnosed with acid reflux for which he is taking 40 mg of prilosec in capsule form ( capsules poured out).  He has also been prescribed ondansetron for nausea ( which does not always seem real effective) also just started him on amitriptyline ( 10mg) just started last night.  had been hesitant to start him on the amitriptyline as the GI specialist said that with as severe and as long-lived as the nausea seemed, he wondered if it was maybe abdominal migraines and that the nausea would not be that long lasting with reflux alone.   So, my thought was if it was abdominal migraines, I wanted to monitor what he had eaten the days the nausea has been really bad.  The common thread I found for each day was caffeine and he loves iced  tea.  He has had six episodes of severe nausea, tingling etc in the last two weeks..... all lasting at least an hour if not more... He also urinates a lot and when he has these episodes and sometimes says he feels dizzy.  My main question is, if he continues to take the amitriptyline, is it then going to be difficult to diagnose him with abdominal migraines ( GI doc said if it is abdominal migraine, that is the med a Neurologist would prescribe).  Can reflux cause abdominal migraines or make them worse?    Looking back over the last couple months when this first started... he has been pale a lot ( looks sick)... we were pediatrician several times and were not to see specialist until next week but when he started losing weight specialist saw us sooner.  Son had difficulty eating at times the past couple of months due to feeling so nauseated and became thinner. and thinner.. trying to get him some relief he is absolutely miserable when he has these episodes.  Having nausea with headache migraines, I know how severe nausea can be... he does not cope with it well at all.  I take something at onset of headache migraines and feel good within a half hour... this is not happening for him...I really dont want him on meds for a long time but since migraines are so strong in our family, I am concerned this may be the case.  Do kids usually grow  out of these if it is abdominal migraine?  Could it be related to his hormones? He is 10 .  Concerned about side effects of med.... maybe things will subside when reflux clears up?  Thanks so much for any help you can provide!!!   Heartfelt thanks!!",

The spot is on the left side and gets caught in his underwear and can occasionally feel achey. Should we be worried.",
    "context": "HelloThanks for query. Based on your statement I would say that your husband has three prominent superficial veins on scrotal sac, These are dilated, prominent superficial veins over scrotal skin and nothing to be worried about it . He should use soft inner wares or soft pads over scrotal sac before putting on inner wares. These are harmless and there is nothing to be worried about it. Chat Doctor.",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 year old fell yesterday and hit her head on concert. There was an instant bump popped up on her head. She acted completely normal after a few minutes. She went to sleep about 2 hours later me and my husband woke her up two times throughout the night. But today she is napping more and has diarrhea is this normal or what should I do?",
    "context": "Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Although the diarrhea is not related to the head injury, napping more in a child of this age is difficult to judge or rule out to be due to the injury. If I were your doctor, I would have advised you to keep a close watch on her level of consciousness to see if she is responding normally to your routine talks with her, and if she is moving her limbs normally, and has not got any vomiting. The bump on her head is due to collection of blood by the injury, and will subside gradually. In case of any change in the level of consciousness of hers to your commands, and any increase in the bump on the head, I would advise you to take her to the ER room of the nearest hospital, where they would examine her closely and if considered necessary might go for some investigations like a CT scan to rule out any concealed head injury. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.",

I know it s down because I start to feel cold, then check my b/p and confirm it s low. I bordered on high before. I m pretty sure I am having gall bladder problems due to the pain in my side, and it is better since I ve cut fat almost completely out of my diet.

I have seen a urologist and had a CT scan and an x-ray and they found nothing, went back for a cystoctomy to scope the inside of my bladder and found nothing unusual. I did find out after the x-ray and CT scan that I only have one kidney; I never knew that. I have no abdominal or back pain, nor do I have pain during urination, I only know that something came out when I look into the toilet. I called my urologist after this happened again, I acquired a sample to bring in, they told me its probably a blood clot and not to worry about it and not to bring in the sample. I also have a hydrocele/vericocele on my right spermatic chord.",

Based on your statement that you have posted the brown particle that you have passed in urine hours after ejaculating is likely to be a blood clot mixed with urine which gets turned up into brown color. In the majority of cases this blood clots originates from a small superficial surface of prostate and gets sealed off itself immediately that causes a tiny blood clot to appear either in semen or urine passes after ejaculation. Since this is single episode and all the tests like C. T scan, X-ray and Cystoscopy did not reveal any pathological lesion you should not worry about it. If you have pain or discomfort due to Varicocele that you have on Rt side use scrotal support. This will prevent sagging of testicles and give relief from pain or discomfort. Chat Doctor.",

There are other iron supplements that are gentler on the stomach, and you may want to discuss this with your doctor. I am assuming you are on iron because your iron is low. You can increase your iron naturally by eating high iron foods such as raises, spinach, molasses and, if you eat meat, red meat is high in iron. Eating a source of high vitamin C along with your iron will increase the amount of iron you absorb, so fruit, vegetables are naturally high in C as is vitamin C enriched juices. Iron should always be taken with food. From what it sounds like, you are not eating with it. Try taking it in the am with food (but not dairy or high fiber foods) and include a source of vitamin C with your iron supplement. Food does decrease absorption, but if the iron is making you nauseous, eat and/or ask to be switched to a gentler form of iron. In summary, take iron in am with food low in fiber and a source of vitamin C. Check with your doctor about these problems and see if there is a gentler form of iron you can take.

Generally during fever, a bland diet, which is smooth and soothing, is preferred. Care should be taken while cooking food and also choosing foods that are easy to digest. Fluids in the form of tender coconut water, barley water, electrolyte fortified water, fresh fruit juice, vegetable soup, buttermilk and water can be given. Begin with semi-solid diet for a few days and then gradually include fruits like bananas, watermelons, grapes and peaches. As the appetite gets better, semi-solid to solid foods can be given. Boiled rice, baked potato, baked apple, yogurt, vegetable soup can be given. Gradually, by 3 to 4 weeks, normal diet can be restored. The following foods to be avoided"

Her most recent PET Scan showed a suspicious area near her pectoral muscle region which lit up on the PET Scan. She has 1 small cluster 3.4cm. How can this be determined if this is cancer or not? What would the treatment options be if it was confirmed to be cancer? Can it be surgically removed?",

In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall. If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied. Cancer cells and non cancer inflammatory cells might be seen on PET scan. It is suggested that in a 3.4 cm area the doctor does a CT guided biopsy and then the diagnosis is confirmed. If confirmed to be cancer then surgery is possible. Please do not worry.",

It would also be important to note that the staph infections were all on finger joints. I was able to keep them drained but there was one on a knuckle and the last time I drained it it felt like it went down deeper than the others. Now the index finger is swelled at the bottom were there was no cut. Does this sound like I need to get antibiotics to fix this issue. Thank you for your time! And any help is appreciated!",
    "context": "Hello, While an occasional infection is inevitable and not a cause for concern, recurrent bouts of various infections should definitely be investigated. In my opinion, you should undergo some tests like Blood sugar test, to make sure you are not diabetic and a complete blood count with your white cell counts and differential counts, to see if there is a problem with your immune system. Additionally, if you are on long term steroid therapy, you could also be prone to infections. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

Although I have done this many times before, I have never done it in front of this many people, and I get extremely shaky, my breathing becomes shallow and I get horrible stomach butterflies, which can really affect my singing in a negative way.

There is no such beverage or food that can increase your confidence unless and until you build it up in your own mind. Your own mind is the best solution for the problem.

Once you will pick up the grip & people front of you will start to respond you in positive manner you will automatically gain the confidence.Don't think that you are short of breath you are the best.

    "question": "Hello! So I have had throat stones appear in my tonsils but they have been appearing more so recently. Also, just since yesterday, I don t see any of the throat stones in the back of my throat but I am still having the bad breath smell symptom from them. And in the back of my tonsils, if I press my finger against the crypts, a whitish/yellowish colored substance oozes out of the crypt. Also, I have had these bumps on the very back of my throat for a few days and just passed it off as an irritation due to an allergy. I am beginning to worry that something is wrong with my tonsils. Do you have any advice or suggestions as to what may be going on? Or what I should do?",
    "context": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The yellow discharge could be a pus from the infected tonsil. It can be secondary to the tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. Consult a ENT surgeon and get it treated. Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500\\u00a0mg and metronidazole 400\\u00a0mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. The halitosis is because of this problem only. Once you get the tonsils treated everything will return to normal. I hope my answer will help you, take care.",

If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\u00a0mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500\\u00a0mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Her bleeding has become better but her HB has fallen down a lot. I am really worried what to do. Should we go for a blood transfusion.",
    "context": "Dear patient. Greetings from Chat Doctor !!!  I am Chat Doctor and shall be answering your question. I can understand your reservations about blood transfusion and when it should be done. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem. Your sister has an HE of 3.5gm/DL. The normal HE for her is 12gm/DL. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroid, nutritional, menstrual loss. HE of 3.5gm/DL is a very low hemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence, I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HE till 7gm/DL. She can then be treated for the cause. She can then be given hepatitis, intravenous iron and treated for fibroid if any. Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence, you shouldn't worry about that, I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me. Yours sincerely, ChatDoctor.",

However then sent him to a neurologist an he diagnosed him with Corticobasal ganglion degeneration I feel like he had a stroke an it went undiagnosed.",

So if your son had that disease at 38 with manifestations starting at 35, he would be an almost unique case in the history of the disease, I would be really careful in taking that diagnosis. As for the distinction between MS and stroke related to the head trauma it should generally be easy with an MRI if history and examination do not already make that distinction. Without knowing more about the signs and MRI report it's hard for me to say something more because these diseases can have many presentations. The seizure would direct more towards the head trauma rather than MS, as would the fact that the deficit has remained constant in time since the hit, without new signs, as you seem to suggest, but as I said MRI and more details are needed. I hope things work out for the best.",

        "Hello, I cannot answer your question because I don't have sufficient information about his specific epileptic disorder. You must speak to the doctor about the REASON he is having such problems.  Sometimes it is possible to retire the medications if he has been seizure-free for a period of at least 2-3 years.  It doesn't sound like this is happening.  Stopping the fits means your doctor should be able to tell you EITHER the underlying cause to his episodes OR the doctor needs to find another combination or another DOSING regimen of medications that can control his episodes.  Also, you can help your husband by making sure he is well HY Chat Doctor.  You should also make sure with the pharmacist that your husband is not taking any other medications or EATING certain foods or beverages that can NEGATE the effects of his medications to control the seizures. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"

    "question": "I have been suffering from an abssess tooth going on 2 1/2 weeks.  I am scheduled to see a specialist on Thursday for a root canal; however I have developed a blister the size of a penny on the roof of my mouth.  Is it okay if I burst this blister?  Its is causing a lot of pain.",
    "context": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint the blister that has caused to you is due to pus formation below the root tips of the infected tooth which at times perforates the bone and appears as a blister below the soft tissues. It is a painful condition, but you should not prick or burst the blister as it will be further painful. You should take antibiotics like Augmenting 625\\u00a0mg three times a day and Tramadol 5Omg thrice a day and Pantoprazole 4Omg empty stomach once in morning.... You can apply numbing gel over the blister for local relief. You should continue with the medicine for 5 days and by then get the root canal started so that the pus finds a way to discharge, and the condition will relieve. Hope this information helps.

    "context": "Hi dear, When a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. Pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. Symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. Weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. So i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. Not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. Patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. I will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.I may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, I can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice I have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.I hope you will carry on with the treatment .TAKE CARE.",

I am a working women and most of my work involve working on the computer.i have the pain the middle of the spine at around the spot where I was give an injection for my c section. Pls advise",
    "context": "Hi, I believe that a good physical workup should be performed to discover the most likely cause of the localized back pain. It seems that you've lost nearly all the weight you gained during the pregnancy, so mechanical causes of back pain are probably less likely.  Still a good examination to distinguish different types of back pain including the possibility of chronic pain following the c-section is worthwhile and can help identify even other causes of chronic low back.  Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture.  In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query.

Psychological stressors causing back, shoulder, and neck pain are very common and even physical stressors such as working on computers without proper back/neck support or not taking frequent enough breaks, or being tensed in the shoulders and arms while typing constantly can play into the picture.  In short, a number of potential causes can be in play.  A good physical examination by a good physician with proper imaging studies and other workup will do a lot of elucidate the root of your problem. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

    "context": "Laparoscopy is a surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube put through a cut in the belly to look at the abdominal organs or the female pelvic organ. Laparoscopy is used to find problems such as cysts, adhesions, fibroid and infection. Tissue samples can be taken for biopsy through the tube. In many cases laparoscopy can be done instead of laparotomy surgery that uses a larger incision in the belly. Laparoscopy can be less stressful and may have fewer problems and lower costs than laparotomy for minor surgeries. It can often be done without needing to stay overnight in the hospital. Laparoscopy is done to check for and possibly take out abnormal growths such as tumors in the belly or pelvis, check for and treat conditions such as endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease, find conditions that can make it hard for a woman to become pregnant, do a biopsy, to look whether cancer in another area of the body has spread to the belly, check for damage to internal organs, such as the spleen, after an injury or accident, do a tubal ligation, fix a hiatus hernia or an inguinal hernia, removal of organs, such as the uterus, spleen, gallbladder, ovaries and appendix. Partial removal of the colon can also can be done and also to find the cause of sudden or ongoing pelvic pain. Risks include bleeding from the incisions, infection and damage to an organ or blood vessel. This may cause more bleeding that needs another surgery to repair.",

If there is recurrent growth of cancer then she must take combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. As you have mentioned that she is too weak for chemotherapy therefore focused radiation remains the most tolerable treatment at the moment, but this depends on the general condition and local recurrence of the disease. Please have a discussion with the cancer surgeon and radiation oncologist and proceed with treatment as per the outcome of discussion. Please do not worry.",

    "question": "Can you get thrombocytopenia from a Shingles vaccine? My husband had a normal platelet level in November and then recently had a severely low platelet level. Medications have all been the same. Only difference is the Shingles vaccine. YYYY@YYYY",
    "context": "Hello, Thank you for your question here at Chat Doctor. I understand your concern and I want to inform you that the Shingles' vaccine can lead to some adverse effects and thrombocytopenia is not listed among one of them. There are some reports of Poltava vaccine leading to thrombocytopenia, but currently we need more proof and clinical studies to affirm that for sure. In other words your husbands' thrombocytopenia may be linked to the Shingles' vaccine, but we do not know for sure at the moment.Meanwhile, please do not worry as this is a transitory effect and the platelet count will rise to its normal value in around 2-4 weeks if we were talking about minor thrombocytopenia from the start. I recommend another platelet count after 1 month just for your psychological comfort. I hope my answer helped you. Do not hesitate to reply if you have further questions, Best",

I am almost 20 years old and two years ago i went to a doctor to try and get some answers. i found that i was noticeably more hyper than any of my friends, i couldn t stop talking, i would get in these weird moods where all i would do is think about random things, i would tap my foot or leg, feel rushed when there wasn t a need to be rushed, and i would always snap on my parents, sometimes for no reason. i went through perscriptions of concerta , adderall , and vyvanse , just recently upping my dosage of vyvanse to 60 mg. my question is, is it common to feel extremely irritable and angry towards people i care about when i accidentally forget to take my vyvanse? this has always been a question i have. i always feel much more calm and relax and not easily angered or upset when i take my vyvanse consistently.",

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has another component which is \\\"impulsivity\\\". Many boys who have attention deficit hyperactivity also have impulsive behavior. For example, they may become aggressive toward their friend, and they feel remorse soon after it. Vyvanse is not only useful for your hyperactivity, but also helps you to manage your behavior.

Chest pain and coughing up mucus so went to the doctor who said i had pharyngitis. 2 weeks after and still coughing i developed really sore ribs especially when laughing, coughing, sneezing deep breathing and lying down in bed. Went to the doctor who said it was the intercostal muscles and gave me pain relief and an inhaler due to shortness of breath. 2 weeks later due to not breathing properly i developed a chest infection given anti biotics. After a month of pain relief and still not much relief she wondered whether the pain relief (diclofenac) was causing reflux making the cough worse so prescribed some tablets to go along with it. The night time cough did disappear. Rib pain is still present when deep breathing especially when exercising. A week ago i really overdone it strenously walking and then 3 days ago developed a cough, that is progressivley getting worse. Last night it caused throat pain whilst coughing and a feeling of a lump in my throat and struggling to breathe took my inhaler and it actually relieved it all. Rib pain is now alot worse again and this is 14 weeks since the illness started. I dont understand why the rib pain hasnt gone and why this cough keeps reoccurring.",

Before ejaculation I let go and ejaculated like normal, but felt an odd somewhat dull pressure/pain on the dorsal surface of my penile shaft about 1 inch above the base (traveling in the direction of my penis, i.e. not horizontal/diagonal). At the area of the pain was now a hardened cord with a bit of a bump at the middle of the cord. It is not visible but can be palpated. It seemed like my penis took longer to become flaccid after that. I stopped any masturbation and let it rest for a week. It seemed nearly better but masturbating very gently caused it to return somewhat. I have gone a bit more than a week without masturbation now but want to check that something like this will go away and not be any long term damage. I still feel a dull pain at the area at times when the penis is flaccid. No issues with erections or ejaculation. Is this a lymph or vein issue?

Agin asked for Contrast CT. and the result shows that the nodule grew to size of 2.6 cm. and am asked for bronchoscopy again.

    "context": "This is likely a growth of some sort, whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) can only be definitively determined on a biopsy. The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth, or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granuloma being the cause of this nodule. TB (tuberculosis) or fungal infections of the lungs can do this. I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for.",

        "This is likely a growth of some sort, whether it is benign or malignant (cancer) can only be definitively determined on a biopsy. The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth, or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granuloma being the cause of this nodule. TB (tuberculosis) or fungal infections of the lungs can do this. I hope this gives you some of the answers you were looking for."

    "question": "My creatine level in February 2013 was o.53 with eEGFR Rate of 99. All other baseline tests were normal except for microscopic hematuria. I am 68 now with pseudomonas bacterial UTI that hasn t gone away even with ciprofloxasin. June 2014 creatine level was 0.9. Using same formula as used in 2013, the eEGFR rate is now 66!!! Same lab says Less than 60 indicates chronic renal disease. I know of NO risk factors (drugs, lifestyle, toxins, hospital care) that would make this happen. I look and feel very good.But the UTI isn t going away. Just saw my doctor, cystoscopy scheduled. He was not concerned.Any reason eEFGR could go down so fast??? (I am doing heavy contructioin work in my house.)",

    "context": "Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. About 90% of the causes are unknown. Most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. Pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. Some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. I am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. The work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as EKG changes. The first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. There are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. Steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. Generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. You should also get plenty of rest.  Some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. You should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. If you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, I would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle.",

    "context": "Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, would examine you clinically to exclude any tenderness (pain on pressure) on the right side of your abdomen, and look for any other signs to rule out appendicitis. If I could rule it out, I would like you to be examined by a gynecologist colleague. At the same time, I would get your routine blood check up done like a CBC, Blood sugar, urine routine and microscopic test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen if need be. Further management would depend on the results of both clinical examination and investigation reports. Till that you might go for an anti-spasmodic Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

    "question": "Hi, my grandmother recently had gall stones removed. She had the surgery a week ago tomorrow and is still experiencing extreme amounts of pain. Additionally, she seems to be having symptoms similar to a urinary tract infection - burning and constant feeling to urinate. Is that a symptom involved with gall stones or the removal thereof? And to add more to all of it, she has been having diaherra for over 2 months. Her doctor precribed her medications for this which help when she remembers to take them, but it seems to be an ongoing issue for her - even more so after the surgery. I m worried that my grandmother may have some other issues going on that the doctors haven t found yet. Can you help shed some light on any of this? Thank you!",

It is more possible reinfection which is common in people that underwent any surgical procedure since their immune system is weakened few weeks after surgery. She should treat it by taking the lot of fluids and antibiotic if necessary. Diarrheas may be experienced after gallbladder surgery but it shouldn't last for more than 2-3 months. If there is no improvement she may need gastroenterologist work up to rule out some bowel disorders. Thanks for the query. Regards",

It most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. You maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day.  A way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee.  Carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night.

Also he has had 2 dui s and a felony for breaking in to beat up his sister s boryfriend. He is highly intelligent, a student as the Uof I. But unable to connect emotionaly.

And it gets bad sometimes when the mold is high. Im wondering do you think I might have COPD or any other serious condition?. Im young and I dont smoke. My family doesnt have a history of diseases so Im at a loss.",
    "context": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are having severe allergies, possibility of asthma or allergic bronchitis is more likely for your symptoms. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). N acetyl cysteine (NAC) is also beneficial to relieve congestion.

As your Gleason score was 10 most probably your disease was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role (pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 NG/ml may indicate biochemical failure. Then your treatment can be changed. Another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 NG/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous.

Motility is usually 90-100 % but in your semen it is 70% so they (sperms) are less motile than normal. Immobile 10 % and this is also normal (normal 10% immobile)20% are straight, and they are dead.  Rest of analysis is non-specific so no discussion. In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion and treatment. Nowadays good and effective medicines are available in market, so you will GE alright in short time. If further any question I will help. Good luck."

If there was no vaginal penetration, then pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you are very concerned, you can still ask her to take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) as a precautionary measure. When taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex, it is more than 80 % effective in guarding against a pregnancy. The expected period can be advanced or postponed for almost a week, after taking the Echo there is no way to predict the next date of her period.

    "question": "Hey my daughter is seven and has been running a fever for2 days. I have been rotating tylenol and motrin every 4 to 6 hours but her temps are really high.105.8 was her last temp taking on her forehead and 107.0 under her arm. I use a digital temporal thermometer would that be accurate and should I take her to the ER?",
    "context": "Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health. Regards -",

    "question": "Hello, my name is Davie. I have severe back and neck problems, have for close to a decade. My entire spine and neck is very sore, nerve problems and no doubt my spine would be out in lots of places. A few weeks ago i started getting pains in my throat, like pain coming from the top of my chest just below my collar bones and traveling up my two neck two arteries. It isnt constant, but is there daily and comes and goes. Its in direct line with where the worst part of my back is, just below my collarbone line. That level is where my back is just beyond sore, words cant describe how bad it gets and i know my spine is out of place badly there. Now at the front at the exact same level is where im getting the pains from that are shooting into my throat. I know that pains like that can be heart related, but i feel fine apart from my back pain, my heart feels okay. Im just wondering can severe back pain and having a spine out of place cause such problems like this at the front. It just feels very tight and i get shooting pains going into my throat, but theres no real trouble breathing, just the usual tightness i feel with my spine being out and being very painful. If i honestly thought it was my heart and i had no trouble at all with back or neck pain, id be at the hospital right now. I just honestly dont feel its my heart and i know how ridiculous my back feels right now with the pain im in. Im only 35, so i dont think its a heart attack or stroke or anything and i have no tingling or numbness or anything in my arms/hands. Just want to know if severe back pain and spine out of place can transfer pain to your front and affect other things to give you the neck pain and chest tightness ive just described.

I m being treated with Ventab DXT 25, Macorate CR200, Wacalert 50 & Zapiz 1.00 whenever I feel more anxiety or seem not able to control my thoughts. Actually, this started in 1998 from Exam Phobia & was treated for same. Since then I ve been in & out on medication from time to time till 2007 from where there s consistency in medication & follow ups. Sutre, the treatment has helped me to stabilize over the period. I ve got married, have a small daughter, completed post graduation, MBA & also did certification in SAP FI. The doctor has been of great help to me. He was of opinion that I ve lesser coping capacity. And, that s not entirely wrong. His major concern has been my changing the job & settling in it. He s slowly started reducing power of drugs with powers mentioned above. But, it seems I ve developed dependency on these medicines. And, I want to stand on my own with my thought controlling me rather than medicines. In this blog, I read in answer to one patient, reference to Meditation, Self Motivation. Meditation or Yoga is okay for me since I ve learned it scientifically. I want to know about self motivation. Is there any specific resource available? How can I access it? Will I ever be able to overcome these feelings? or they ve become a part of my personality? I wish to live a life free of medication & complete self reliance.

If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly.

    "context": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Not getting pregnant within two months of regular contact is not a big thing to be worried. If you are not able to conceive even after 6 months of regular contact then you need to go for investigations.  It is possible to have occasional ovulatory cycles in spite of you having regular periods. The frequency of sex during these two months also matters. Ultrasound examination for follicular study during the expected ovulatory period will reveal the presence of ovulation. Other factors like tubal block, cervical factors, Congenital anomalies, hormonal factors and immunological factors are to be investigated to find out the causes for infertility if you have not conceived even after 6 months. Wish you best of luck.  Chat Doctor. Morgan",

Leaving smoking helps.  - Hormonal imbalance can be controlled with Cyclical oral contraceptives.  - Medicines like Metformin, Camphene are tried to stimulate ovulation - If nothing helps, surgical Chat Doctor.  * For this you should approach a gynecologist & after pathological tests.

I have felt pressure in my chest especially when I exercise & just a little bit when at rest for about the last 6 weeks which I ignored until my EKG result. I have an appointment with my cardiologist in 9 days. What do you think are the possibilities? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.              Howard Watt",

The cause of the same depends on the reason why mitral valve repair was done. Generally the possibilities are 1) Higher lung pressure causing right valve leak, dilatation or decreased pumping 2) The repair has lived its time as its 7 years, and the disease might have progressed 3) Any new mitral disease 4) In previous era, tricuspid valve was not repaired even if it had moderate to severe disease considering its self healed after mitral repair.  So the same may have progressed 5) Fall in function of left beret post mitral repair. There can be Hun Chat Doctor.  The treatment for the same is based on etiology. Regards",

Actually for anxiety symptoms, though diazepam (Valium) will help you symptomatically, there are better options than taking Valium. Discuss with your psychiatrist about taking some SSRIs along with your routine Chat Doctor.  Also benefits of CBT and psychotherapy cannot be overemphasized for you. Trying seeing your psychiatrist soon and do discuss your concerns in detail with him/her. Hope I could solve your concerns."

I just was in the ED and had a CT scan and it read that I have a new cystic area on the right pelvic sidewall measuring 8.5cm in AP by 6.3cm in transverse dimension.  This measures 4.7cm in craniocaudad dimension.  Single septation.I have had a TSH and left oopherectomy and only the right ovary remains.  I am 45 years old and everything I am reading online is scaring me about the size of this cyst.I just had a laparoscopy in April to remove adhesions and this wasnt there.  How could a cyst grow that quickly?Is it a high percentage that large (>7cm) cysts are cancerous?  How can it be diagnosed as beneign or not?  is that only through laparoscopy?Thank you for any thoughts. I am very nervous!",

I am 34 years old, male. No health issues. I do feel my heart flutter once and while and just feel tired.. Is this a normal reaction to being sick?",
    "context": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that this feeling looks like a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia (an episode of atrial fibrillation or flutter, frequent ectopic beats or even ventricular arrhythmia, etc.). There is only one way to confirm any possible arrhythmic events, by means of ECG registering during such unpleasant feelings. The most appropriate option would be to undergo an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (Holder test). In addition, I would recommend you to perform a medical check up by your internist or cardiologist, for a comprehensive physical exam, a resting ECG, chest X-ray study, some additional lab tests like complete blood count, PCR, Thyroid, liver, renal function tests, blood electrolytes, etc., to rule in/out any possible flu complications, like thyroiditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, etc. that may lead to generation of cardiac arrhythmias and altered overall health status. A cardiac ultrasound would be necessary, if suspicions of myo-pericarditis, etc. are raised. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!",

In past few months under my tongue is swollen and VERY painful (pain radiates to jaw) the swelling (mouth floor and clavicular)and pain come and go and I cannot tolerate the pain and numbness /Tingling anymore, nasty taste after swelling goes down... after reading a lot ... how do the drs distinguish if it is a ranula or a plunging ranula?

If this manual permeates through the mylohyoid muscle and spreads down to neck region and produces swelling in the neck region below the mandible, it is called a plunging manual. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out, because infection arising from the teeth can also result in pain and swelling of similar kind. Get an ultrasound done to rule out the pathology. If it is diagnosed as manual or plunging manual, then it has to treated surgical to prevent complications like difficulty in swallowing, respiratory problems. The nasty taste can be because of the contents of the cyst which gets burst following any trauma to the cyst. I hope my answer will help you, take care.",

Many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case.  If it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would repeat it in a week if that is the case. In addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. If you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks.  You should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,",

As to let you know one of the primary act is thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised and also the cardiac clearance before undergoing gym.

Due to overtraining there will be a sudden muscle spasm due to stretch contract mechanism on the elliptical. Taking a rest with hot water fermentation should reduce the pain and after 3 days you can go back to gym. Also, if the pain doesn't come down, than taking up a thorough musculoskeletal and cardiac assessment is advised on a safer side. Since you have discomfort on the right side, the worry is less, may be just a muscle spam on the right Hyperion Chat Doctor.  It should subside in short time. This is on of the common injury in gym, as the body is not prepared to undergo the stress & strain on the muscles.

    "question": "Hi, I need an advice regarding the possibility of being pregnant. I m a virgin. Me and my boyfriend were messing around yesterday somewhat and things got a bit *hot*. We didn t have penetrative sex, but he fingered me and I gave him a handjob. He touched his penis- while pulling it out of his pants- but then I immediately started giving him a handjob so the contact was brief and I don t think there was any precum as his penis was not even fully erected yet. After a few moments he began unzipping my jeans, etc (so he definitely has brushed his fingers against my clothes) and then fingered me (but not very deep). Also it was day 21 of my cycle (usually my cycle varies from 27 to 31 days, so I guess my ovulation should has happened already). I understand that chances of me getting pregnant are very low but still... should I be worried?",
    "context": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about pregnancy. For pregnancy, Intercourse in vagina and ejaculation of semen in the vagina is must. This should be happened during Fertile period (ovulatory) period of your cycle. Since you don't have Intercourse in vagina and you're were not in your Fertile period, no need to worry about pregnancy. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

    "question": "Hi. I had a housemate who had this grotty blistery thing all over his feet, which I seem to have caught. I had hoped that when he moved out it would have cleared up, which is not the case. Between the toes, and on the side of my foot Ive had several outbreaks, and when the blisters burst it seems to spread. The blisters and sites in general are very itchy. In the last week I had a large one of these blisters develop on the bottom of my foot, and when it burst it has become quite painful and red and seems to be infected. The skin around this area is also very itchy and is painful to walk on. In the last two weeks I have been working in a very dirty workshop, which would include exposure to dust, dirt and chemicals, and since my work boots are old and full of holes it is more than possible that some of this stuff has gotten into my shoes and to the infected site.Now, Im planning on going to the free university doctor on Monday, because as a student I cant afford to go to one of the emergency weekend docs, so I would like to know if there is anything I can do to reduce swelling or fight infection in the meantime.Thanks muchly",
    "context": "Hi there, As you have rightly concluded, we need to deal with the wound infection first, and deal with the blisters later when your university doctor can have a look at it.  What I would recommend right now is some anti-inflammatory tablets like diclofenac or even ibuprofen to help deal with the swelling and pain on walking.  For the infection itself, if you could get your hands on some antibiotic cream like mupirocin or acidic acid it would be useful to apply it twice a day to help control the infection.  If you are not able to get the antibiotic cream, find yourself some antiseptic cream with chlorhexidine or iodine to just help kill off whatever surface bacteria is there.  Try to clean the wound twice a day with some antiseptic solution to just get rid of any discharge and bacteria that is collecting on the surface.  Keep it as Chat Doctor. Your university doctor would reassess it on Monday and be able to prescribe you oral antibiotics if needed, and further treatment for the blisters itself. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "HI Im 23 years old, a year ago I was living in  south america and got a bad case of what i thought was tonsillitis.  After a two week period of antibiotics was able to come back to the states and saw my dr who after doing some lab work diagnose me with Mono.  Recently my lab work showed very elevated liver enzymes so i had to see a specialist who  found salmonella in my system.  Could the original diagnose of mono had been incorrect and all along i had salmonella?",
    "context": "Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, thank you for your query. Yes, it is possible, but mono is more likely since there was throat infection associated with elevated LFT. Salmonella rarely cause LFT elevation unless there was blood poisoning. So I suggest doing blood tests to verify is it mono. This is routine test today. After you establish right diagnosis, the treatment can be started. Wish you good health. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi Doc, I am having this problem of shortness of breath for last 3 years now. The problem is usually elevated when whether is more humid and its raining. I have been smoking for 8 years until last 5 months. I drink 2-3 times socially in a week as well. I consulted a specialist last year, and was told it is an allergy and would be trated over the period of time. For the last few days, the shortness of breath is severe and can not sleep also because of this. I am also having pain in right lower chest when deep breathing. I stay in a very humid place in the world (singapore) and one thing i have noticed that on a very humid day, this problem turns back with nausea as well. I consulted a doc few days back (General Physician) and he gave me some tablets (allergy and to clear the air ways). It worked for 2 days. The problem turned back again after a day. (Its raining again !!) what are the possible causes of this problem? Is there anything to be worried.what tests do you suggest me? Appreciate your help ! Thanks Doc, JayD",
    "context": "Hello Mr Jay. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I guess you have quit smoking for last 5 months, and if I am correct, congratulations on that. It is a very important step for your respiratory complaints. From your history, I would conclude that you are having recurrent breathlessness, worsening on humid days. You may be having allergy to house dust mite or molds, which increase in concentration during humid days or pollen which are released during rainy season. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will take your detailed history and suggest allergy testing. He may suggest you allergen immunotherapy after allergy testing. If you have frequent shortness of breath, you may need daily controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, montelukast, etc.)I would also suggest spirometry with reversibility testing. This test is helpful to differentiate between asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Apart from these, ensuring proper sunlight & ventilation in your rooms, avoidance of smoke-dust-air pollutants and regular breathing exercises will help you on a long run. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, my 3 and a 1/2 year old brother had his ruptured appendix removed by surgery five days ago. He came back from the hospital today. After the surgery, his stomach was seriously swollen, which the doctor said was due to gas. He often felt nauseated, and even vomited, once a day after the surgery, every evening. He also complained of pain in hi stomach/ abdomen area but since he is young and very weak after the operation, he didn t exactly point where it was paining. I m really worried because the vomiting is usually a symptom of appendicitis so it should stop after the appendix is removed. Also, the doctor had said his swollen stomach would gradually reduce but it hasn t. What is wrong with him?",

Leukemia is rare, you should visit doctor if you find something suspicious but spare your child of unnecessary blood testing every time you notice fever, bruise or cough. Wish you good health."

The pain in the cheekbone and temple, front of neck and the bones around the eyes could be because of the ill-fitting denture, or it can be because of the high points in the denture or any sharp borders in the denture. These causes result in abnormal forces over the facial musculature and results in pain. Consult a prosthodontist and get the denture corrected or repeat the denture. For the pain you can take analgesic with muscle relaxant(tablet flexion MR). I hope my answer will help you, take care.",

A cause is usually sought to know exactly what causes this increase. Its worthwhile doing tests to for viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B and C which normally should be excluded in such cases. The increase in the liver enzyme levels in your case is not that alarming, and confronting these results with other results are required for any appropriate interpretation and adequate concluding clinical judgements could be made.

Okay how can they be so sure, when I was told to come back in four days for my results. Can you give me some other reasons what may be going on with me? Unless they are right. I hope not, because that means my partner of 8 years is sleeping around unprotected. Thank you, A concerned one",
    "context": "Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The symptoms of abdominal pain and passage of white substance in your stool points more to an intestinal infection than an STD. I would advise you to go for a stool test for ova and cyst and get it treated if positive which would relieve you of your symptoms. Chances of having an STD with this kind of symptom would be remote, and if in doubt get yourself investigated as advised by your treating doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.",

    "context": "Your description of your daughters' problem shows that she has anemia which you think might be sickle cell trait or Thalassemia. First test which can be performed is a reticulocyte count. If this is high it is a hemolytic anemia. A peripheral smear should be done which will make the picture clearer. A bone marrow biopsy can be done to rule out plastic anemia or other bone marrow abnormalities. All these tests will help you to narrow down the diagnosis",

I engage in vaginal and oral sex. I want to know what are the chances of having cell changes in the neck region as well? And what is the risk of gettting head and neck cancers from hpv? Also is it safe to still engage in oral sex with my boyfriend at this point (protection or no protection)? Thank you in advance.",
    "context": "Hi, You said that you have been diagnosed with CIN2. It is an abnormality of cells in cervix that can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. CIN2 means between 1/3rd and 2/3rd cells in cervix are transformed onto abnormal cells. It is caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV doesn't lead to any changes in your neck. Certain types of HPV causes cervical cancer and certain types of HPV causes genital warts. HPV does cause pharyngeal cancer. But it generally occurs in males above 40 years of age. So, It's quite uncommon in a young woman like you. No need to worry about it. As you already have developed HPV infection, you need not be worried about getting new HPV infection from your boyfriend. But always make sure to use protection like condoms. They protect you from all kind of sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, etc. And coming to the treatment part, your gynecologist will perform some procedure like laser therapy, freezing therapy (cryotherapy) to remove the abnormal cells. She might also use LL ETZ (a procedure using a loop of wire) to remove or scrape out the abnormal cells. Also make sure to undergo repeat testing of pap smear and colonoscopy after 6 months of having treatment for your CIN2.",

Taking Anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil or Tylenol may help you to continue to heal.

But it must be further evaluated by clinical examination and some relevant tests.

You may take over the counter painkillers and antipyretic like Tylenol or ibuprofen along with antihistamines like cetirizine 10 mg for symptomatic relief from your these symptoms. Also, take plenty of water with fruit juices for faster recovery and for symptomatic relief. But the important thing is to rule out infective component by clinical examination and above-mentioned investigations since you still feel mild dizziness and fever. For that, you may need to see some local physician or visit ER who will know about it and may order prescription. If there is some infection detected, then he/she will prescribe you appropriate antibiotic course like 3 or 5 days as per severity of symptoms. Hope this will help you.",

    "context": "Hi.thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor. Further evaluation advised. Ultrasonography is recommended to rule out gall stones. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones, though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder-surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid (UCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller (weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy. Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health.

But this pain didnt start until yesterday and it comes and goes and i get numbness to my face. Do you think to could be nerve issues from my adjustments or could it be something more and should i go to the hospital?",
    "context": "Hello! I read carefully your question. Regarding your concern I think it may be an occipital neuralgia. The numbness of your face may be caused by a hypersensitiveness of the trigeminal nerve in the brain. Cervical column arthritis can also cause this type of neuralgia by compressing the occipital nerve. I would recommend consulting with your GP, have a good neurological examination and a cervical column x-ray. A brain CT scan may be necessary to rule other causes like a brain tumor, which may cause similar symptoms. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes!",

    "question": "Hi,My teeth are all straight except that I have a overbite,and a gap in my front two teeth(I used to suck my thumb when I was little)I went to a dentist and he told me I would get a retainer to pull the front teeth together and move them inwards to get rid of the overbite and spacing,But the issue I have is that the underbite causes my face to look shorter,when I move my lower jaw outwards to get closer to my upper teeth my face looks much better,Does an overbite mean that my jaw are not align correctly?I d like to know if braces can actually move my lower jaw outward rather than moving my upper teeth inward or is there any other option that can do that, Im a 20 year old female am I too old to have my jaw align since I dont think its growing anymore?",
    "context": "Positioning you jaws by bringing them in front would not give you the correct idea of how your face would look after the correction of your overbite. Correction of overbite would not make your face looks shorter at all it would rather improve your profile. There are ways when the jaws are corrected and positioned differently to align them more aesthetically called distraction oogenesis, but that would be done only if the jaw alignment is improper. In your case a retainer and alignment of teeth would suffice so you needn't think about the jaw surgery unnecessarily. Also, overbite can have LNG term effects in the gums leading to more problems so I would suggest you to start the treatment without any further delay.",

    "context": "Hi, Multiple sebaceous cysts over the scrotum is a rare condition but should be promptly treated if infected to avoid complications that can be harmful to your in the future. Best is to consult a surgeon who can examine you and confirm the diagnosis. Once confirmed, a carefully planned surgery must be done to remove the cysts and then probably reconstruct the scrotum using skin flap surgery. Applying cream may not always help and if ignored then you might end with a potentially life-threatening condition which can lead to infections and gangrene of the scrotum.

    "question": "right shoulder problemHello Doctor. I injured my shoulder two days ago while wrestling with my cousin. I was in a head lock underneath him when he decided to trip me and bring me to the ground. When we fell, all of his body weight landed on my right shoulder and I instantly felt a swelling sensation. I was still able to movw my arm afterwards but as the shouldwr cooled down it made it impossible for me to move it without assistance. Aboit a year ago I was playing football and threw a ball against the wind. When I did that I felt a small pop in the middle/center parr of my shoulder. I did see a therapist for it and had it fixed. This pain is similar but more intense. My shoulder is not poped out but my rotation is very limited. I have to assist my right arm even when I am laying down. Whether its putting my arm on my stomach or above me it still needs assistance. Whenever I feel I want to move my arm anywhere, I feel I have to battle a tweak inside my shoulder. Would this be a rotater cuff injury or just some swelling that isnt allowing my arm to move yet? I fell like something needs to pop back into place but only slightly. Im told that that feeling is because of the swelling. It also hurts to get up and lay down. I did not ice right away but I did apply salon pas and also tiger balm. Do you have any advice for me? Thank you for your time and help.",

    "question": "I am a 62yr. old female diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer in 2006. Metastases was to the liver, omentum, lining of the pelvic floor, and 3 out of 15 lymph nodes, along with the colon. I have had a colon resection and aggressive chemo then remained on maintenance chemo until 2009 when I had a recurrence in the right ovary. I had a hysterectomy and another 6month regimen of chemo. Since that time I have been on maintenance chemo. Had a surgery to remove extensive scar tissue and part of the small bowel due to freq. bowel obstructions. My only symptoms of gluten intolerance could also be due to the chemo so I m wondering if I have some intolerance. I do get some discomfort after eating, had freq. constipation until I began taking probiotics and sometimes Metamucil. I now have a ventral hernia and don t have as much constipation. Now I have lower left quadrant pain off and on. The Pet Scan showed something in the colon but the colonoscopy showed nothing. My CT Scan showed small lesions on my liver and kidney which are too small to determine what they are. I already had some cysts on my liver and kidneys but these are new. My CEA goes up and down from 3.4 to 4.3. My CEA when diagnosed with stage IV was only 7.6 so my doctor has increased my chemo and may go to other drugs but I am anxious about that because no one can determine if I have cancer or not. Do you have any thoughts about it?",
    "context": "Thanks for the query. Unfortunately this very serious disease and terminal stage of malignant disease.

Last week she had problem of high fever and was unconscious. Later she was diagnose with meningitis which was cured after week of vaccination. Further doctor suggested for MRI scan (there was leak) in which we can see open hole. After which we consulted neuro surgeon they confirmed hole is still there and we need to open brain to fix it. So looking this to be big and complex surgery I consulted ENT team and they again did endoscopic (as I mentioned this CSF leak is intermittent, so during endoscopic check up there was no leak) and mentioned there is no leak. As per them this intermittent leak can be due to high CSF pressure and suggested for diamox 500 mg. So just wanted to check",

Anyway, you should also exclude other reasons for your headaches like sinus problems, refractive errors etc. It is because of the asthma that you feel tired even after rest. Since you stay in a cool place at high altitude where the atmospheric oxygen concentration is lower, you can use a nebulizer for better relief. Also, steroid inhalers are needed to prevent attacks as they reduce the need for bronchodilators which usually have unpleasant side effects. Permanent cure for asthma is not possible, but you can keep the symptoms at bay by avoiding triggering factors and taking anti-histamines whenever needed. You can try yoga and Panama when there are no attacks. Please consult a pulmonologist for further advice. Good luck.",

    "question": "HI At my last appointment with my heart specialist the doctor increased my dose of Carvidilol (Coureg) to 12.5mg twice per day in the hope that this would decrease the chances of an AFIB event, in fact he said I can eat anything now. Unfortunately over Christmas I had two or three AFIB events each of which subsided after a few hours and where my pulse fortunately never reached over 124 ppm ( at least when I checked it ). The reason for the events was probably due to over indulgence in foods that may have had higher levels of sodium chloride at the same time as drinking a lot of wine and on one occasion brandy. On a normal day my pulse is 49 to 52 in the morning and seldom gets above 65 even after some fairly heavy physical activity. It does go up to mid to high 60 s if I have two or three glasses of wine. Normally of course I am on a very low salt diet as my wife and I make almost everything from scratch ourselves without adding sodium chloride. The reason I am writing is that early March we are traveling to Australia for a month followed by a month cruising back to the US. I don t know whether I will be able to get low or no salt food on board the ship. I m wondering whether an even higher dose of coureg might be advisable during the trip to counter the unknown levels of salt I will encounter on the voyage. Thanx Keith Jones",
    "context": "Hello, Your dosage or Carvedilol is optimum and increasing it at present is not justified as you already have low borderline pulse (50) at rest and increasing the dose may bring it more low which would cause fatigue and weakness on routine activity. Mostly you would be able to tolerate normal salt in cooking. Just avoid breads, bakery products and preserved food as they have higher salt content. Avoid Bing Chat Doctor.  If you have an Atrial fibrillation episode, taking a higher dose e.g. 25 mg max of carvedilol single dose, would be ok. But taking on routine basis is not a good idea. Also discuss the need for anticoagulation with your doctor on next visit. Regards",

I taken Goodova tablet from 6th day of my periods(06th March, 2014). Doctor suggests to have a intercourse between 10th March,14 day to 20th March,14 as I might have ovulation only on those days. But I had my periods till 14th March,2014. After that, We had a regular intercourse till 20th March. I did home pregnancy test on 30th March. But Negative result. I have a few queries",
    "context": "Hi there, Welcome to Chat Doctor, If your period lasted from 1 to 14 March you have had a prolonged bleeding and might not have ovulated in this cycle. Yes, it is possible that some women do not respond to Good ova (Camphene), these could be due to Camphene resistance or improper use. If you have been diagnosed with PCs delayed periods and an ovulation are common, and it could be due to the same that you have not yet got your period. You need to get proper medication for PCs, Metformin 500 mg twice a day is advisable and can be continued even when you get pregnant. It is not advisable to take thyroid tablets unless you have a documented thyroid deficiency, it will not help you to take it randomly. Diet, exercise and Metformin will help you with the PCs. For ovulation induction with Camphene you need to take Camphene from day 2 to day 7 of the cycle and undergo follicular monitoring from day 9 of the cycle to track the ovulation.Also, Folic acid should be taken by any women trying to conceive. You could take Phaeton to get your period and start Camphene from day 2, after confirming with another pregnant test that you are definitely not pregnant. Hope this helps. Regards.",

    "question": "I was coughing for the past month and have asthma like attack when I wake up coughing at night. A Dr told me that I might have walking pneumonia and gave me some antibiotics. Towards the end of my cough the left side of my rib started to hurt (about two weeks ago). I had that side of my rib injured before (hairline fracture). Which I think may be a reinjury of some sort due to excessive coughing, however, in the past week this pain had traveled from my left side and extend to my right side also. However, the right side pain is more towards the sternum. I don t feel extensive pain going about my day, just have a hard time getting up in the morning when it hurts the most, and when I have any residual cough. Not sure what is wrong with me, and are there thing I can do to get better?",
    "context": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. It can cause excessive coughing, asthma like attacks, chest pain on coughing etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
